## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#install.packages("usethis") # if you don't have it already.
usethis::use_course("biostats-r/svalbardQuartoDemo")1

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
library(usethis)
use_github()

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
